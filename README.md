# Friday-Project-9
Project for my DS-3850-001 class, over 4.1 AI Completions

instructions:
• Create an interactive GUI that will allow the
user to type the prompt into a text box
• A submit button should execute the completion
• There should be an output box that displays
the output from the completion
• Use a .env file to store your API key
• Have instructions for me to test it using my
own API key
